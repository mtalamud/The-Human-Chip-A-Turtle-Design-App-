# The-Human-Chip-A-Turtle-Design-App-
A creative project as part of the Individual Project for ENGR 13300: Transforming Ideas to Innovation made completely using Python!


To run the program - download all the required image files and put them in the same directory as the source code on your desktop. Then go to visual studio, open the folder and then run the code - enjoy!


Any curiosities to the inner workings of the program and reasons to why the program was made or what it aims to accomplish can all be satiated with the report in the github.

Cheers!!
